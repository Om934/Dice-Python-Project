# Dice-Python-Project

In a dice game, each player is supposed to roll five dice, the one with the highest score is considered the winner.
If the player throws six in his five opportunities or toss the same number twice in a row, he will get another chance.
The player forfeits all further chances and the game ends if he throws the same number three times in a row.
